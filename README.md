## Hi there and Welcome to my GitHub page! 💻
 👋 I'm Ionut (**John**), a motivated and adaptable **Junior Ruby Full Stack Developer** with a passion for building user-friendly, efficient, and scalable applications. My journey into tech started with a strong curiosity for coding, and now, I'm eager to contribute my skills to real-world projects.  

 ## 📖 About Me  
I have a background in **International Hospitality Management** but made a bold move into tech after discovering my love for problem-solving and development. My experience as a delivery driver refined my ability to think on my feet, manage time effectively, and work under pressure—all skills that I now apply to software development.
